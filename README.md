# One Shot Learning using Memory-Augmented Neural Networks in Tensorflow

Tensorflow implementation of the paper *One-shot Learning with Memory-Augmented Neural Networks*. 
Current Progress of Implementation:
- [x]  Utility Functions:
  - [x] Image Handler
  - [x] Metrics
  - [x] Similarities
- [x] LSTM Controller
- [x] Generator
- [ ] Omniglot Tester Code
- [ ] Unsupervised Feature Learning through Autoencoders
- [ ] Cattle/New Born Recognition

The benchmark dataset is [Omniglot dataset](https://github.com/brendenlake/omniglot). All the datasets should be placed in the [`data/omniglot`](data/omniglot/) folder.
